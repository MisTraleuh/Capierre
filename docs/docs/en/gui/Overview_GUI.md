# 💻 Overview

Because **Capierre** is an open project open to everyone, we needed to create a graphical interface to make everyone’s work easier. This GUI is divided into several sections, each with a specific role.

## 👋 Main page

Here is the main page of the Capierre graphical interface:

Once you’re here, in the left navbar you have the option to perform other actions.

## 🫣 Hide Data

This is the main page for hiding data:

Once the data is hidden, it returns a fully compiled and functional binary:
- If you want to hide data in a binary, you can do so by clicking the **Hide Data** button and selecting the binary file to modify.
- If you want to hide it using source code, you can click the **Hide Data with Source Code** button and select both the binary file to modify and the source code to use for hiding the data.

## 😝 Extract Data

The page for extracting data:

Once you’ve extracted the data, you can view it on the **Extracted Data** page, which is located in the left navbar.
