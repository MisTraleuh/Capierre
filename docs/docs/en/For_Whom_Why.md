This steganography tool is intended for anyone looking to conceal information within binary files. Whether you are an IT security professional, a developer, a student, or simply curious, Capierre is made for you. Our goal is to make steganography accessible to everyone by offering a user-friendly and effective tool. We are far from the complex and difficult-to-use tools available on the market. Iâ€™m referring to tools like **Steghide** or **OpenStego**, which are references in the field of steganography but are far from being simple to use for a novice.

With Capierre, you can hide information in binary files with just a few clicks, without needing advanced technical knowledge. Thanks to an intuitive GUI and simple features, you can conceal information in binary files without any hassle.

:::tip ðŸ“– Why use steganography ?
Steganography is a data concealment technique that dates back to antiquity. It has been used by many peoples and civilizations to transmit secret messages. For example, the Spartans used wax tablets to write secret messages. They would then scrape the wax to write a visible message, then cover the wax with a new layer to hide the message. Only the recipient knew the technique to read the hidden message. You can find historical examples of steganography in this [article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9ganographie#Histoire) or this [article](https://anticopedie.fr/WordPress/?p=721)

Today, steganography is used in a number of fields, particularly in IT, to conceal sensitive information in digital files. For example, a journalist can hide sensitive information in an image to protect his sources. A developer can hide login information in a binary file to secure his application. The use cases are many and varied.

Capierre was designed to meet the growing need for security and confidentiality in the digital world. With the increase in cyberattacks and data breaches, it has become essential to protect sensitive information. **Steganography** is an effective technique for concealing information within digital files without raising suspicion. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable, **steganography** hides data by embedding it into existing files such as images, videos, or audio files.

Letâ€™s take a concrete example.

You are a **journalist**, and you absolutely need to send a document to one of your colleagues for reason X or Y. This document contains sensitive information that you donâ€™t want just anyone to read. At this moment, you have several options:

- You could encrypt the document, but this might raise suspicions. Encryption is often associated with illegal or suspicious activities. Additionally, if someone intercepts the encrypted document, they might attempt to decrypt it.
- You could send the document through simple means, like email or WhatsApp, but it could be intercepted by malicious parties. If data is retrieved, it could be used against you or your source.
- You could print the document and send it by mail, but this could be intercepted along the way.

There is a quote I read once that says "The best hiding place is the one that is not looked for." This is exactly what steganography offers.

With steganography, you can hide the document in an innocuous image, like a vacation photo. No one would suspect that the document is hidden in the image. And for a binary file, even fewer people would suspect that the document is concealed within a binary file. Only the recipient would know the technique to extract the hidden document.
